In this folder you'll find various example files created with Simple Spreadsheet. I've created them to test various abilities of the program:

* FACTURA.SSF: Invoice example;
* CURSO.SSF: Student table with grades and averages;
* FUNC.SSF: Math functions to test the chart plotting;
* GOL.SSF: Game of life implemented with the logical operators;
