# What is this?
SS (Simple Spreadsheet) is a command line spreadsheet program for DOS made in Turbo Pascal 7. 
I made it when I was still a student for a school project and thought it was lost forever until I found it on an old external HDD.
It's pretty feature-complete, supporting crude mathematical formulas, graphical representation of data and even printing [!]
The original README is in portuguese and the formatting is all off, so here's the gist of it:

# Keys
* Cursor keys: change cell
* ENTER: Set a cell value (start with '=' for an expression)
* '.': copy cell
* '-': paste copied
* Z, X, C: Change text alignment
* W, E: Increase / decrease column size
* S, D: Increase / decrease line size
* O, P: Change currently selected background color 
* L, Ã‡: Change currently selected text color
* Q, A: Change background / foreground colour to currently selected colors
 
* ESCAPE: Enter command mode

Cells are identified by their column name and line number (ex: A12, D4)
